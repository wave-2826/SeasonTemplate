# The "swerve thing"

Goals:
- Improved odometry
- Improved power consumption
- Improve swerve wear patterns
- Avoid tipping
- Understand when the drive is well-controlled
- Improve code architecture
- Smoother acceleration/better traction

Components:
- System-wide acceleration limiting
	- Forward limits: maximum acceleration based on speed
	- Tilt limits: acceleration per-axis limit based on CoG
	- Skid limits: acceleration limit based on skid torque
- Skid detection
- Odometry which prioritizes tractive wheels
